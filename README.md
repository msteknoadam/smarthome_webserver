# smarthome_webserver
This is the repo for Smart Home Project's webserver files.
I'm really thankful for my ISP since they won't let me open ports so I have to set up a different server then connect both my client & Raspberry Pi to the same server while I could just connect to the server on my Raspberry Pi if I could open a port. Basically, you just need to do `npm i` on the root folder of this project and then run `npm run start`. _I really hope that_ I will make this compatible with nginx so when you just copy the given nginx config file, the webserver should be directly accessible on port 80. Currently, it uses port 3000 so for example, when you run it on your localhost, you need to connect to `localhost:3000` instead of just `localhost`.
